#	The following is an example of using Wildcat to create
#	references ( symlinks ) to existing media rather than
#	transcoding every file.

streams:
	source:
		path: "**/*"
	mp3:
		path: "/mp3/**.*"
		input: "source"
		if:
			meta:
				type: "audio"
		build: 
			ifMeta: 
				subtype: ["mp3","mpeg"],
				bitrate: { "$lt": "200kbps" }
			then:
				# This is it. One little directive will automatically
				# create a link from the input file to the output file.
				link: true
			else:
				# If the file doesn't match, here's the trancoding script
				# to create a derived mp3 file.
				{ tool: "ffmpeg" },
				"-i", { input: true },
				"-codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 3",
				"-f mp3",
